# ClearLand
AI-Powered Environmental Monitoring Platform

Illegal dumping, deforestation, and unauthorized construction are difficult to monitor at scale.  
The goal of this project is to use AI and geospatial tools to analyze satellite and drone imagery, automatically detect violations, and store them in a spatial database.

## Problem Statement / Project Goal
Illegal dumping, deforestation, and unauthorized construction are difficult to monitor at scale.  
The goal of ClearLand is to use AI and geospatial tools to analyze satellite and drone imagery, automatically detect violations, and store them in a spatial database.  
This provides insights for enforcement, urban planning, and recycling initiatives.

## Tools I’m Using

### Programming
Python

### Imagery Sources
Sentinel-2  
Drone Mapper Data  
Wayback Imagery  
Google Earth API  
Copernicus Browser  

### Geospatial Libraries
rasterio (for reading and writing GeoTIFFs)  
shapely (for geometry handling and GeoJSON creation)  
geopandas (for spatial joins and vector analysis)

### AI / Computer Vision
PyTorch or TensorFlow (for object detection)  
YOLOv8 (for image recognition)  
OpenCV (for preprocessing and Gaussian blur for privacy)

### GIS Platforms
QGIS  
Google Earth Engine

## Data I’m Using
Open satellite imagery (Sentinel, Landsat)  
Public zoning shapefiles and environmental boundary datasets  
Small drone image sets (simulated or open datasets)  
Custom-labeled bounding boxes or polygons for training detectors  

## Solution Model

### Detection
Train a computer vision model to identify illegal dumping sites, tree loss, and construction in restricted areas.  
Uses a grid-based structure for large-scale detection.

### Privacy
Apply person detection and automatic blurring (via rasterio, shapely, and OpenCV) so individuals are never identifiable.

### Spatial Analysis
Convert detections into polygons and cross-check them against zoning maps and environmental boundaries using shapely and geopandas.

### Database
Store flagged events with coordinates, type of violation, and frequency of occurrences.

### Insights
Generate spatial reports showing hotspots, temporal trends, and data for government enforcement or recycling programs.

## Vision
ClearLand bridges environmental science and AI to create a transparent system that detects environmental harm and promotes sustainable land management.  
Future plans include real-time dashboards, predictive models, and automated alerts for agencies and organizations.
